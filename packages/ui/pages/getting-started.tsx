            didn&apos;t get your wish exactly right. Hopefully it at least gave you a useful starting point.
          </p>

          <p>
            After signing in and exploring the app in its current state, head over to the Code Genie docs to learn more about{' '}
            <a href="https://codegenie.codes/docs/guides/define-an-application/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
              App Definitions
            </a>
            . Then, modify the existing data model inside your project&apos;s `.codegenie` directory and run `npx @codegenie/cli generate`
            (without the `--description` flag) from within your project directory to regenerate the project based on your changes.
          </p>

          {/* <p>
          Note that the generate command will overwrite existing files within the project directory. If you&apos;ve made changes to generated files, be sure to first stage/commit them and then merge the changes as necessary (ignoring anything that overwrites your changes).
        </p>

        <p>
          If your changes to the data model include major changes such as deleting or renaming entities or relationships, changing ID properties, etc. then you will end up with unused/orphaned files. <strong>Coming Soon:</strong> To prevent this, Code Genie will soon let you run the generate command with the `--cleanup` flag: `npx @codegenie/cli generate --cleanup`.

            When you&apos;re ready to deploy a production instance, run `npm run init:prod`. Note that all of the `:dev`-suffixed commands
            have sibling `:prod` commands also (e.g. `npm run start-ui:prod`, `npm run deploy:prod`). Commands and configuration also exist
            for a staging environment.

          <Typography.Title level={3} id="set-up-custom-domains">
            Set up custom domains
          </Typography.Title>
          <p>
            Custom domains for the Web App and API can be specified in `packages/cdk/cdk.json`. We recommend leaving the dev environment
            without a custom domain for simplicity, but you can add one if necessary.
          </p>

          <p>
            It&apos;s a good idea to leave your root domain for your marketing/content website (e.g. example.com) and use subdomains such as
            `app.example.com` for your Web App, and `api.example.com` for your API. Consider prefixing the staging environment with
            `staging.` (e.g. staging.app.example.com and staging.api.example.com).
          </p>

          <p>
            After updating `cdk.json`, run `npm run deploy:prod` from within your project directory and wait for deployment to complete.
          </p>

          <p>
            To complete setting up a custom domain for your Web App, follow the instructions in the{' '}
            <a
              href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/to-add-a-custom-domain-managed-by-a-third-party-dns-provider.html"

              Amplify docs for third-party DNS providers
            </a>{' '}
            beginning at the <strong>View DNS records</strong> step. If your domain is managed by Route53, you don&apos;t need to follow
            these steps.
          </p>

          <p>
            To complete setting up a custom domain for your API, open the `packages/cdk/cdk-outputs.dev|staging|prod.json` file and copy the
            value of the `RegionalDomainName`. Create a CNAME record in your DNS settings and enter your domain in the Host (e.g.
            api.example.com), and paste the `RegionalDomainName` value as the Answer/Value.
          </p>

          <p>Remember, DNS can take several minutes to propagate.</p>

            Set up custom emails

          <p>
            Once you have custom domains set up, you may want emails to also come from those domains. Out of the box, the main types of
            emails that Code Genie apps send are verification emails (upon registering) and forgot password emails. If you&apos;re using the
            Organization permission model, emails are also sent when inviting other users to join an organization.

            </a>{' '}
            and follow the steps to get your AWS account out of sandbox. This primarily consists of verifying ownership of your domain name
            via DNS settings and making a support request. See Code Genie&apos;s guide on{' '}

          </p>
          <p>
            After your AWS account has been granted production SES access you can update the `email` property of `packages/cdk/cdk.json` for
            the environment(s) that you want to use custom emails: `&#123; &quot;production&quot;: &#123; &quot;email&quot;: &#123;
            &quot;verifiedDomain&quot;: &quot;example.com&quot;, &quot;verifyUserEmail&quot;: &quot;verify@example.com&quot; &#125; &#125;
