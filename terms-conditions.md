1.  **Engagement and Term**

    1.  ## These Terms apply from when you sign up for an Account, until the date on which your Account is terminated in accordance with these Terms. We grant you a right to use our Platform for this period of time only (which may be suspended or revoked in accordance with these Terms).

You are responsible for paying any levies or taxes associated with your use of our Platform (unless we are required by law to collect these on your behalf).

        are not liable for disruptions or downtime caused or contributed
        to by these third parties.

## [Our Platform]{.underline} {#our-platform .list-paragraph}

1.  ## We own all Intellectual Property Rights in our Platform. This includes how our Platform looks and functions, as well as our copyrighted works, trademarks, inventions, designs and other Intellectual Property. You agree not to copy or otherwise misuse our Intellectual Property without our written permission (for example, to reverse engineer or discover the source code of our Intellectual Property), and you must not alter or remove any confidentiality, copyright or other ownership notice placed on our Platform.

2.  ## We may use any feedback or suggestions that you give us in any manner which we see fit (for example, to develop new features), and no benefit will be owed to you as a result of any use by us of your feedback or suggestions.

**[Your Data]{.underline}**

3.  ## We do not own any of Your Data, but when you enter or upload any of Your Data into our Platform, you grant us the right to access, analyse, backup, copy, store, transmit, and otherwise use Your Data while you have an Account with us (and for a reasonable period of time afterwards). We may use Your Data (or disclose it to third party service providers) to:

    a. ### supply our Platform to you, and otherwise perform our obligations under these Terms;

    b. ### diagnose problems with our Platform;

    c. ### diagnose problems with or allow for debugging of the Source Code;

    d. ### improve, develop and protect our Platform;

    e. ### send you information we think may be of interest to you based on your marketing preferences;

Once anonymised, we own that data and may use it for our own purposes, such as to provide and improve our Platform, to develop new services or product offerings, to identify business trends, and for other uses we communicate to you. This may include making such anonymised data publicly available, provided it is not compiled using a sample size small enough to make underlying portions of Your Data identifiable.

7.  ## If you do not provide Your Data to us, it may impact your ability to use our Platform.

```{=html}

```

7.  **Confidential Information and Personal Information**

    1.  ## While using our Platform, you may share confidential information with us, and you may become aware of confidential information about us. You agree not to use our confidential information, and to take reasonable steps to protect our confidential information from being disclosed without our permission, and we agree to do the same for your confidential information. This also means making sure that any employees, contractors, professional advisors or agents of ours or yours only have access to confidential information on a 'need-to-know basis' (in other words, the disclosure is absolutely necessary), and that they also agree to not misuse or disclose such confidential information.

    2.  ## However, either you or we may share confidential information with legal or regulatory authorities if required by law to do so.

    3.  ## We collect, hold and disclose and use any Personal Information you provide to us in accordance with our privacy policy, available on our website, and applicable privacy laws.

    5.  ## We may need to disclose Personal Information to third parties, such as our related companies or our service providers (for example, IT and administrative service providers and our professional advisors).

8.  **Consumer Law Rights**

    1.  ## In some jurisdictions, you may have guarantees, rights or other remedies provided by law (Consumer Law Rights), and these Terms do not restrict your Consumer Law Rights. We will only be bound by your Consumer Law Rights and the express wording of these Terms. Our liability for a breach of your Consumer Law Rights is, unless the laws of your jurisdiction state otherwise, limited to either resupplying the Source Code, or paying the cost of having the Source Code resupplied.

    2.  ## Subject to your Consumer Law Rights, we do not provide a refund for a change of mind or change in circumstance.

    3.  ## If you accept these Terms in Australia, nothing in these Terms should be interpreted to exclude, restrict or modify the application of, or any rights or remedies you may have under, any part of the Australian Consumer Law (as set out in Schedule 2 of the _Competition and Consumer Act 2010_ (Cth)).

9.  **Liability**

    1.  ## Regardless of whatever else is stated in these Terms, to the maximum extent permitted by law:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

(a) neither we or you are liable for any Consequential Loss;

(b) a party's liability for any Liability under these Terms will be
reduced proportionately to the extent the relevant Liability was
caused or contributed to by the actions (or inactions) of the other
party, including any failure by the other party to mitigate its
loss;

(c) (where our services are not ordinarily acquired for personal,
domestic or household use or consumption) in respect of any failure
by us to comply with relevant Consumer Law Rights, our Liability is
limited (at our discretion) to supplying the Source Code again or
paying the cost of having the Source Code supplied again; and

connection with these Terms will be limited to the Fees.
